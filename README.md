# Product Owner Manual
#### By: Ben Pearo

## Before we begin
The quality of a product owner can make or break a project. The product owner is responsible for setting the requirements for a project, comminicating them, tracking their progress, and making adjustments when the developers meet roadblocks. All of these activities have major impact on the working experience of the development team, both for headspace when tackling problems, and having adequate resources to approach a task unassisted.

## Product Requirements
These are the features that you would like the product to have. Projects like yours aim to solve a problem, and the requirements are components that build that solution.

### Gathering Requirements
I'll be advising under the context that you personally have faces challenges that your product aims to solve. If this isn't the case, most of this information should still be useful.
* Think of the challenge you've faced, and brainstorm how things could have been made easier or more intuitive
* Ask your group the same question, their experiences were likely different, and would offer a different point of view
* Create a questionarre or document to give context to these brainstorming questions
  * How could x have been made easier
  * What frusturated you while preforming x
  * What features would make x more useful to you
  * What do you think should be easier to access in x
* You can distribute this questionarre to samples who might have faced the problem you aim to solve
* Look at how other people are attempting to solve this problem, or similar services that do certain things better

### Specifying Requirements
Your requirements will be translated into "User Stories" for the dev team to carry out. The format of these would be, "As a User, I should be able to ___."

If you have a background in software development, resist the urge to get specific with implementation. You might think you know best, but it's important to let the dev team work with what they're comfortable with. Your concern is the final product, or finished features. Don't concern yourself with how it was accomplished, your job is to let the developers know if their work fits what you envisioned.

### Prioritization
The most essential part of requirement gathering is prioritizing them. Doing this will give the team much more autonomy and take away decision making pressure down the line.
I found it best to prioritize the most essential features first so the minimum viable product (MVP) would be finished as soon as possible - giving a strong base to add features on to and keep the ball rolling. This will make sure they have a project to submit!

## Team Meetings
### Presenting the Requirements
Once you've compiled and prioritized your project requirements, you must communicate them to the team. During this sesstion, read them the requirements and discuss. You will be answering questions, and likely end up revising some requirements to make them more clear. The team might know out of the gate that some of the features would be impossible to implement in the timeframe, so work with them to adjust the complexity, or potentially remove the feature alltogether.

### Future Meetings
To keep up with the team's progress, have meetings every two weeks, or following the team's sprint retrospective.

#### Your goals for each meeting are to:
* Assess progress since the last meeting
* Discuss difficulties and roadblocks
* Make adjustments to difficult project requirements so the team can move forward
* Adjusting requirement priority based on the team's progress
* Plan on what tasks should be done next

This process can be relatively simple if you and your team agree on the priority of requirements. When adding tasks for the next sprint, you can just take them off the top of the priority list. Confer with the team about what would be a reasonable amount of work to assign over the next sprint.

#### General Tips
* Don't penalize slow progress, it's the team's mark. Not yours.
* Be solution-oriented. If progress is slow, discuss adjustments to speed up development
* Be encouraging, and let them know you're impressed with their work!
 * Keeping the team motivated creates a better atmosphere during meetings, and keeps the team on the ball
* A demonstration of the project so far will help you decide if your requirements are being met, or need adjustment
